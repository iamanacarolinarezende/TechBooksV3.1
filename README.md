# Author-Book-Categories Management System

This project is a **book management system** built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **ASP.NET Core Identity**. It allows users to manage authors, books, and categories, providing functionality to associate books with authors and organize them into categories.

## Technologies Used

- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for managing data access with relational databases in C#.
- **ASP.NET Core Identity**: A membership system that provides user authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **Manage Authors**: Create, read, update, and delete author details.
- **Manage Books**: Add books with the option to associate them with one or more authors and categories.
- **Manage Categories**: Organize books into different categories, making it easier to filter by genre or topic.
- **Associations**: Easily view which authors wrote specific books or what books belong to certain categories.
- **User Authentication**: Built-in user registration, login, and role-based access control using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.
